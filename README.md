# Core Algorithms & Data Structures in C ⚙️

Welcome to my rigorous portfolio of algorithmic problem-solving. This repository contains my implementations of foundational computer science algorithms and data structures (following the LeetCode / NeetCode standard), written entirely in **pure C**.

## 🎯 Purpose & Philosophy

While modern, high-level languages like Python or C++ offer built-in structures (like Hash Maps or dynamic arrays), I chose to implement these solutions in C. This forces a deep, foundational understanding of:
- **Manual Memory Management:** Explicit use of `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` to allocate structures precisely on the Heap.
- **Pointer Arithmetic & Low-Level Logic:** Manipulating memory addresses directly to achieve optimal data access.
- **Asymptotic Mathematical Rigor:** Every solution is strictly evaluated for its Time and Space complexity.

This repository serves as my personal training ground for competitive programming, system design, and high-performance computing logic.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by algorithmic patterns to ensure a structured progression of logic:

- `01_Arrays_and_Hashing/` - Fundamentals of contiguous memory and space-time tradeoffs.
- `02_Two_Pointers/` - Optimizing iterations for linear $O(n)$ time complexities.
- *(More categories to be added as the study progresses: Sliding Window, Stack, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.)*

## 🔬 Documentation Standard

For every algorithm implemented, I provide:
1. **Clean, documented C code** (`.c` file) that compiles without warnings and handles memory safely to prevent leaks.
2. **A localized README** explaining the theoretical approach and the mathematical Big-O analysis for both Time $O(T)$ and Space $O(S)$ complexities.

## 👤 About the Author

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Palermo, Italy, with a strong focus on mathematical logic, procedural programming, and high-performance system architecture. 
This portfolio is part of my continuous preparation for elite software engineering roles and open-source contributions (such as high-energy physics data models).
